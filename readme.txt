== Description ==

The SitePoint Base base theme is a clean, fast and simple platform for creating beautiful, responsive custom WordPress themes. It's a simple and elegant starter theme built on HTML5 & CSS3. At its core is a fluid, responsive grid based on percentages. This means not only is it flexible, it's extremely easy to customise.

If you do decide to use a child theme with Sitepoint Base, there's no need to use CSS @import or even enqueue the parent stylesheet. Sitepoint Base will automatically enqueue the parent stylesheet for you. Cool eh!

SitePoint's base is a fluid, responsive grid based on percentages. It uses [Normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) to make sure that browsers render all elements more consistently and [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) for detecting HTML5 and CSS3 browser capabilities along with some default stylings from HTML5 Boilerplate. It also incorporates the gorgeous [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icon font by Dave Gandy.

The main navigation uses the standard WordPress menu. Support for dropdown menus is included by default. If you'd like to envoke a button toggle for the main navigation menu on small screens, simply uncomment the two lines from the sitepointbase_scripts_styles() function within functions.php to register and enqueue the necessary javascript file.

If you're looking to build an eCommerce website, Sitepoint Base supports the excellent WooCommerce plugin, straight out of the box.

Templates

SitePoint includes a set of your most common theme templates, including templates for Full-Width pages, Left Sidebar, Right Sidebar (default), Front-Page, Tag, Categories, Authors, Search, Posts Archive and 404.

If you're using one of the many page builder plugins that are available, such as Visual Composer, Beaver Builder, Divi Builder, SiteOrigin Page Builder or the Elementor Page Builder, try using the Page Builder Full-Width Template or the Page Builder Boxed Template. The Page Builder Full-Width Template is a true full browser width template while the Page Builder Boxed Template contains your content in a boxed layout. If you want a completely blank full-width page with no header or footer sections, such as for a landing page, then there is also a Page Builder Blank Template. Depending which Page Builder plugin that you're using, you may find that one template provides a better layout than the other.

Post Formats

All the standard WordPress Post Formats are supported. These include; Aside, Gallery, Link, Image, Quote, Status, Video, Audio, Chat and of course, your standard post.

Widgets

Widgets are a great way of adding extra content to your site and SitePoint Base has a whole assortment of them.

Main Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on posts and pages
Blog Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on the blog and archive pages only
Single Post Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on single posts only
Page Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on pages only

The Footer Widget areas are dynamic! You can use up to four of these and they'll magically space themselves out evenly. For example, if you only add widgets into the First Footer Widget Area, then it will expand the full width of the page. However, if you add widgets to all four Footer Widget Areas, they'll magically space themselves out over four equal columns.
First Footer Widget Area: Appears in the footer sidebar
Second Footer Widget Area: Appears in the footer sidebar
Third Footer Widget Area: Appears in the footer sidebar
Fourth Footer Widget Area: Appears in the footer sidebar

Since SitePoint Base is a starter theme to kick off your own awesome theme, the first thing you want to do is copy the Sitepoint Base folder and change the name to something else. You'll then need to do a three-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

1. Search for SitePoint Base inside single quotations to capture the text domain.
2. Search for sitepointbase_ to capture all the function names.
3. Search for Sitepoint Base with a space before it to replace all the occurrences of it in comments.
   (You'd replace this with the capitalized version of your theme name.)

or, to put it another way...

Search for:'sitepoint-base'
 Replace with:'yourawesomethemename'
Search for:sitepointbase_
 Replace with:yourawesomethemename_
Search for: Sitepoint Base
 Replace with: YourAwesomeThemeName

Lastly, update the stylesheet header in style.css and either update or delete this readme.txt file.
